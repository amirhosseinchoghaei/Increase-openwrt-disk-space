# Increase openwrt Disk Space With USB Drive

Hi Again , I made a script to Increase Your Openwrt Router Disk Space With USB Drive

Step 1 : Plug in USB Drive to the router

Step 2 : ssh remote openwrt and run this command

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/amirhosseinchoghaei/Increase-openwrt-disk-space/main/exroot.sh && chmod 777 exroot.sh && sh exroot.sh
```

Done ! After Reboot Login to openwrt And Check Status Page Storage | Disk Space
IF You have problem please Try another USB Drive
